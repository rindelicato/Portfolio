### About Me
Hello, I'm Robert Indelicato, proudly born and raised in New Jersey. I'm a dedicated individual who thrives on the satisfaction of completing a day's work to the best of my ability. Music is my true passion, particularly playing the piano.

One of the most significant lessons life taught me at an earlier age was during my pursuit of competing in the Carnegie Hall student competition. This endeavor required months of rigorous preparation, mastering some of the most challenging piano pieces. Despite not succeeding in the first two years, I remained undeterred and driven to achieve my aspirations.

My perseverance paid off when I secured victory for three consecutive years, earning the prestigious opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall. This journey instilled in me invaluable insights into the importance of perseverance in adversity, the strength of unwavering determination, and the profound impact of never giving up on one's dreams.

This carried over into my educational pursuits where I graduated with dual majors in Criminal Justice and Political Science with a minor in Cyber Security. This gave me a broad foundation in the Legal System, government institutions, and Intellectual Property. My first job working as a research analyst for the Civic Operations Group was contracted by the New Jersey Department of Health for a COVID-19 outreach program. This job introduced me to working with government and demographic data to identify underserved areas of the community. My passion for data analysis grew, and I had the opportunity to further my career working for Amstat Corp as a data analyst focusing on aviation data. Throughout my years working for Amstat, I wanted to further pursue and refine my data analyst skills, so I decided to enroll in CareerFoundry.

Throughout my researched anaylist postions at Deartpemt  of Health of New Jersey I gained first hands on experience in gathering and collecting data from various communites in New jersey that were affect by Covid-19 and draw recommendations to offer resources to the communities.
