# Data Analyst

### About Me
Hello, I'm Robert Indelicato, born and raised in New Jersey. I'm a dedicated individual who thrives on the satisfaction of completing a day's work to the best of my ability. On a more personal level, I have a passion for music and enjoy listening to all types of genres.  As a hobby I sometimes like to take a song that is stuck in my head from a movie or the radio and play improv on the piano. When I was younger I had formal music lessons. My journey as a young pianist spanned well over a decade of intensive lessons and training, instilling in me a profound understanding of the commitment necessary to pursue excellence.

One of the most impactful life lessons I learned stemmed from my pursuit of excellence in music. As a young piano student, I aspired to compete in the Carnegie Hall student competition, a journey that demanded many months of intensive preparation on complex & passionate piano compositions in order to measure up against some of the State's finest student musicians. Despite initial setbacks of not qualifying in the first few years, I remained undeterred, driven by an unwavering determination to turn my dreams into reality.  My persistence bore fruit when I finally won the competition for three consecutive years, earning the esteemed opportunity to showcase my talents at Carnegie Hall. This transformative journey underscored the vital importance of resilience in adversity and the enduring power of unwavering determination. It's a mindset I carry forward in my career, approaching challenges with the same tenacity and commitment to excellence.

This determination also extended into my academic journey, where I graduated from Rutgers University with dual majors in Criminal Justice and Political Science and a minor in Critical Intelligence. With this academic diversity I developed strong policy analysis skills, navigated legal and ethical considerations, mastered quantitative research methods, and applied critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Combining my minor in Critical Intelligence with expertise in security and risk assessment, alongside pattern recognition skills, enables me to proficiently uncover potential threats, assess their implications, and extract valuable insights from datasets as a data analyst

My professional journey started as a research analyst for the Civic Operations Group, collaborating with the New Jersey Department of Health on a pivotal COVID-19 outreach program. This role immersed me in the intricacies of government and demographic data analysis, aiding in the identification of underserved communities. This experience fueled my passion for data analysis, leading to a role at Amstat Corp as a data analyst specializing in aviation data. Motivated by a commitment to ongoing development, I sought to enhance my analytical and technical proficiencies through enrollment in CareerFoundry, aspiring to apply these refined skills across various industries as a data analyst. In addition, I remain open to exploring new  opportunities that align with my skills and interests.
